## Overview

A Project that compares statistical data between 6 of the bigget Tech Companies. Seeing as it is unfair to compare these companies that specialize in different filds strictly by "the biggest number" we will analyze growth under the follwoing categories:


 1) Offices to employees ratio
 
 2) Revenue growth rates.
 
 3) The flunctuation of stock prices.
 
 4) Current Number of job oppertunites available
